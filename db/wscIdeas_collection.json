A lacklustre quarter for Apple further subjected it to the wrath of a major selloff. As the dust begins to settle, I see a very good opportunity to once again invest in Apple, which should rebound swiftly given its robust product line, innovation, and gradual shift in focus towards its services segment with higher retention rates and commendable gross margins.","postedBy":"Jdoe1","postedAt":"1 Jan 2019","upvoteCount":"9","downvoteCount":"3","comments":[{"commentAt":{"$date":"2019-01-06T17:22:49.939Z"},"_id":{"$oid":"5c323db77150a444f4b6e9b2"},"vote":-1,"commentText":"While the stock has gotten cheaper, still doubt its at its lowest point. I think there is still a lot more downside to be priced in, especially given that competitors are evidently taking away Apple's market share through undercutting and comparable, if not superior, products (in one way or another)."},{"commentAt":{"$date":"2019-01-06T17:42:15.231Z"},"_id":{"$oid":"5c323e01c43631404093b37a"},"vote":0,"commentText":"Test"},{"commentAt":{"$date":"2019-01-06T17:42:49.298Z"},"_id":{"$oid":"5c323e1a6e4fde31bc34ff73"},"vote":0,"commentText":"Test"},{"commentAt":{"$date":"2019-01-06T17:42:49.298Z"},"_id":{"$oid":"5c3241646e4fde31bc34ff75"},"vote":1,"commentText":"Agree with OP, and disagree with comment above.

With the imminent expiry of patents covering some of its most valuable drugs in its pipeline, it is unclear whether Pfizer has what it takes to ramp up innovation and preserve a competitive moat to enhance its revenue stream. For now, it is difficult to find any further upside from its current valuation.","postedBy":"Marcus_Wright","postedAt":"30 Dec 2018","upvoteCount":"6","downvoteCount":"7","comments":[{"commentAt":{"$date":"2019-01-07T07:54:45.345Z"},"_id":{"$oid":"5c3306b150da850200fc079a"},"vote":1,"commentText":"I think it'll take a while for Pfizer to enhance its pipelines with novel drugs.
